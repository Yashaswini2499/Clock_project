# Clock_project
The Basic Clock Project uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to update time in real-time. It displays hours, minutes, and seconds, refreshing every second without reloading the page. A simple yet effective project to learn DOM manipulation, styling, and the JavaScript Date object.
